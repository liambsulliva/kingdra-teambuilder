## 👋 Introduction

Below is a Pokemon teambuilder I wrote for my friends in our 2024 Summer Pokemon Draft League. It is somewhat like fantasy football, where you draft pokemon in order. But you battle with them yourselves and use their strengths to your advantage. This teambuilder allows the user to preview the perfect team before actually drafting their picks.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

- `next dev`: Starts the development server and watches for changes.
- `next build`: Builds the project for production.
- `next start`: Previews the production build locally.
- `next lint`: Lints the project using ESLint.

Make sure to install the Next CLI by running `npm install next`.
To create a new app with next, use `npx create-next-app@latest` instead.
